# Step 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) into the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the project files into the container
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the app using a lightweight web server (nginx)
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the previous step to the nginx server
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for the container
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx when the container runs
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
